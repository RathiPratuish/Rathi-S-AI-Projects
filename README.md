Applied Statistics Project - Milestone 1 and Milestone 2
The Applied Statistics Project - Milestone tackles three distinct problems in different industries. It involves data analysis and hypothesis testing to provide insights on stone suitability for printing, the effectiveness of a fitness program, and the impact of dentists and implant methods on metal implant hardness. These findings will support data-driven decision-making and operational improvements for the respective companies.

Segmentation using Clustering and PCA
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques. 2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.
