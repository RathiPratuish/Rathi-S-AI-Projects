Applied Statistics Project - Milestone 1 and Milestone 2
The Applied Statistics Project - Milestone tackles three distinct problems in different industries. It involves data analysis and hypothesis testing to provide insights on stone suitability for printing, the effectiveness of a fitness program, and the impact of dentists and implant methods on metal implant hardness. These findings will support data-driven decision-making and operational improvements for the respective companies.

Segmentation using Clustering and PCA
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques. 2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.

Computer Vision
Company X owns a movie application and repository which caters movie streaming to millions of users who on subscription basis. Company wants to automate the process of cast and crew information in each scene from a movie such that when a user pauses on the movie and clicks on cast information button, the app will show details of the actor in the scene. Company has an in-house computer vision and multimedia experts who need to detect faces from screen shots from the movie scene.

The dataset comprises of images and its mask for corresponding human face. The objective is to build a face detection system.

The dataset comprises of face images. The objective is to create an image dataset to be used by AI team build an image classifier data. Profile images of people are given.

2. Company X intends to build a face identification model to recognise human faces.

The dataset comprises of images and its mask where there is a human face. The objective is to have a  Face Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest.
