Insufficient lighting: The faces that were not detected may be in areas of the image with poor lighting. This can make it difficult for the face detector to recognize them.\n","\n","b. Occlusion: The faces that were not detected may be partially or fully occluded by other objects, such as hands, hair, or sunglasses. This can also make it difficult for the face detector to recognize them.\n","\n","c. Angle of the face: The faces that were not detected may be at an angle that is not ideal for the face detector.

Size of the face: The faces that were not detected may be too small or too large for the face detector to recognize.\n","\n","e. Quality of the image: The faces that were not detected may be in images that are blurry, noisy, or have low resolution.

Ensure that the images are well-lit and that the faces are not occluded by other objects.\n","2. Try using a different face detector. There are many different face detectors available, and some may be more accurate than others for your particular application.\n","3. Experiment with the parameters of the face detector. For example, you can adjust the minimum face size or the scale factor.\n","4. If you are using a Haar cascade classifier, try training your own classifier with a larger and more diverse dataset of images.\n","5.
